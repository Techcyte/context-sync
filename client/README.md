# Client

The demo client is an `npm` project so npm must be installed to run it. It can be installed from [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

To run the demo client first run `npm install`. After that finishes run `npm run start` to run the demo client.
The demo client should open up in the default browser.

The UI in the demo client is very simple. For the best understanding of how the LIS protocol works it is recommended
to have the console open. There will be messages printed to the console that show the flow of the LIS protocol.
